Remarks about the data:

- All datasets are OpenStreetMap data that can be downloaded from https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/nordrhein-westfalen/koeln-regbez.html

- They come in pairs: A dataset "geb-XXX" contains the buildings and a dataset "XXX" contains the roads

- The larger datasets "mehlem-sued/geb-mehlem-sued" are only used for the evaluation of the running time in our publication. The other 15 datasets are also used for the other parts of our evaluation.
